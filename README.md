Intelligent Point Cloud Filter (X, Y, Z)
  Description
  This desktop application, developed in Python with Tkinter, allows you to import, visualize, and filter 3D point clouds generated by laser scanners. The points have Cartesian coordinates (X, Y) and an elevation (Z).   The tool helps clean data by removing points outside a user-defined rectangular area.

Main Features
  -Import .txt files containing point data separated by spaces (X Y Z).

  -Interactive 2D visualization of points on the XY plane using Matplotlib.

  -Input fields to set boundary limits defining a rectangular area of interest (Xmin, Xmax, Ymin, Ymax).

  -Filter points to keep only those inside the defined limits.

  -Export the filtered point cloud to a .txt file.

  -Clear visualization with points rendered above the grid for better clarity.

  -User-friendly controls suitable for users without technical background.

Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher

Libraries:
  -tkinter (included with standard Python)
  -pandas
  -matplotlib

Install dependencies with:
  pip install pandas matplotlib

How It Works
  1)Run the Python script.

  2)Click "Import TXT" to load a .txt file containing points.

  3)The file should have three columns separated by spaces or tabs: X, Y, Z.

  4)The points will be displayed on a 2D XY plane graph.

  5)Enter boundary values for Xmin, Xmax, Ymin, and Ymax to define the filtering rectangle.

  6)Click "Filter" to show only points inside this rectangular area.

  7)Optionally, export the filtered points by clicking "Export TXT".

Input Data Format
  -Plain text (.txt) file with three columns:
    X: Easting coordinate (float)
    Y: Northing coordinate (float)
    Z: Elevation or height (float)

Columns separated by spaces or tabs, without headers.
  -Example:
   East     North    Elevati√≥n
  3000.10  70000.00   120.5
  3001.50  70001.20   121.0
  3003.00  70002.10   122.3
